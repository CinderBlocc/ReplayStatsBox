# ReplayStatsBox
- This plugin adds the statistics box to replays. Normally the box is only seen in the bottom left corner when spectating a live game and is not available in replays.

- If you want this plugin to automatically run, add <b>plugin load replaystatsbox</b> to /bakkesmod/cfg/plugins.cfg
To get to that folder: in the bakkesmod injector click File > Open BakkesMod folder, then you will see the <b>cfg</b> folder
